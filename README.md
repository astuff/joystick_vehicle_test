# Overview
The joystick_vehicle_test module is used to verify that the SSC is operational.  It is similar to the ROS joystick node with some notable exceptions. 

This application is intended to convert the user's joystick commands into gear, steering, speed, and turn signal commands
to pass to the AutonomouStuff Speed and Steering Control software.  Use the launch file provided to start this module
and the joy node.  The SSC and drive-by-wire modules need to be started outside of this launch file.

Once the software is running, push either both engage buttons on the joystick or both the cruise control set/dec and
 decrease gap buttons on the steering wheel (not supported on all platforms) to take control with the joystick,
 ENGAGED will be output to the screen. The desired speed defaults to 0 mph when you engage, so the software will
 automatically engage the brakes.
 You can also choose to enable the speed and steering modules individually (not supported on all platforms).

You can then press the drive button to place the gear in drive, since the desired speed is still zero the brakes
will still be applied.  Pressing the speed up and down buttons will increment and decrement by the configured step
amount, limiting the speed between 0 and the maximum speed set.  Any time a speed button is pressed the new desired
speed will be output to the screen.  To bring the vehicle to a stop, step the speed back down to zero, and the control
software will gently apply the brakes to bring the vehicle to a stop.  Pressing the brake trigger will cause the
desired velocity to drop to zero, effectively applying the brakes. (The brake pedal can always be applied by the driver
 to override the joystick control mode.)

The steering gain and exponent convert the steering joystick to a desired curvature which is passed down to the
steering model.  The gain defines the maximum curvature, so the default of 0.12 1/meters allows for a minimum turning
radius of about 8 meters.  The exponent controls the shape of the response: a number closer to 2 or above will mean
small joystick movements will translate to very small desired curvatures and therefore steering wheel angles,
a number closer to 1 will mean the curvature varies more linearly across the full joystick range.

The curvature command can also be changed by pressing the left and right steering buttons.  The updated curvature
will be output to the screen.  The steering joystick will override the value set with the buttons.

The left and right turn signals can also be controlled with the buttons.  The turn signals will stay on as long
as the button is pressed.

Pressing either the disengage button on they joystick or both the cruise control set/inc and increase gap buttons on
the steering wheel will give control back to the driver (as will any drive override on the brakes, throttle, or
 steering wheel).  DISENGAGE will be sent to the screen, or a message with information if there was an override.

It is also intended that this application be used as an example of how to interface to the speed and steering control
 software modules and can be used as a starting point for the development of higher level autonomy features.
